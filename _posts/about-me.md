ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a Fullstack Software Engineer. I build features in React, Next.js, Typescript, REST/GraphQL on the front end and Node/Express on the back end. I love PostgreSQL databases. 

I work on an open source developer tool that helps developers identify security risks in their GraphQL APIs. The latest feature of SafeQL is schema-parsing to pull out risks like circular logic and visualizing it on the front end with ReactFlow.

Below is some work I would like to showcase for you:

## SafeQL
Hereâ€™s a [Medium article on SafeQL](https://medium.com/@egkopin/introducing-safeql-7fe98fb3598d) that our team put out when we launched. SafeQL is a developer tool that I worked on from the ground up. We used React, Typescript, CodeMirror (for the IDE) and ReactFlow for the visualization. I write more extensively on the product here in this post. 


## React / TypeScript, Next.js / MDX / Vercel Blog
This site youâ€™re on is a bit of pride and joy for me. I am using Next.js, a React framework that is optimized for SEO as well as fast load times. I can write blog posts using MDX and incorporate React components in my blog posts easily. Iâ€™ve written more about the reasoning for my choices in this post.


## Mikspress e-commerce using the Shopify headless CRM and GraphQL endpoints

Mikspress is a greeting card company founded by me with unusually hilarious, yet overwhelmingly sentimental text based greeting cards. The sayings are letterpressed (for the most part) on a vintage Heidelberg machine, which I can proudly say I know how to run thanks to the 10,000 hours I spent behind the machine running and fixing issues on the press.

So what does this have to do with tech you say? Well, eventually this passion for printing became an online venture. A Wordpress woo-commerce blog had to be migrated and lo and behold I found myself learning more about SEO than I would ever want to know. I also came to love Next.js in its earlier versions with getInitialProps.
