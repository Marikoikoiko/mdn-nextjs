I like doing research about what tools to use so that I'm not just spending time on building an app with tools that don't fit the project. Recently I did some research on testing tools. I like to summarize them, so I figured I'd do that here on this blog and share for reference. The information isn't new, but it's a summary of what I found most useful. I link to the source below.

| E2E Tool         | Selenium                                                                                       | Cypress                                                                             | Playwright                                                                                     |

| **Speed**        | Slow execution, executes remote commands in the browser                                       | Fast execution, runs inside the browser                                              | Fast execution, can run tests in parallel                                                       |
